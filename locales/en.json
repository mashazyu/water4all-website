    "projectIntro": "Berlin has over 220 public drinking fountains — but fewer than 40 are visible on Google Maps. Information about clean drinking water is scattered and often hard to find. Our project makes it easy for everyone to locate free, safe drinking water across the city.",
    "subproject1Title": "Water Map",
    "subproject1Description": "We created a simple Google Map with all known public drinking fountains in Berlin. Save it to your phone and quickly find water whenever you need it.",
    "subproject2Title": "New Drinking Fountains",
    "subproject2Description": "We’re working to bring more drinking fountains to quieter neighborhoods outside Berlin’s busy center — areas that currently lack this essential infrastructure — so everyone has easy access to free water.",

    "subproject1Details": "We have already added drinking fountains from Berliner Wasserbetriebe and aim to create a comprehensive overview of free water sources in Berlin.",
    "subproject2FullDescription": "Another part of our initiative is promoting the installation of new drinking fountains in high-traffic areas in Pankow.",
    "subproject2Details": "We know that similar initiatives have already been successfully implemented in other districts of the city. We hope that by the end of our project, we will be able to prepare a guide that will help residents of other districts achieve the installation of drinking fountains in their areas.\n\nAs part of the project, we decided to focus on installing drinking fountains in two locations: at Kissingen-Stadion (Kissingenstraße sports ground, Forchheimer Str. 22, 13189 Berlin) and at the large children's playground on Trelleborger Straße. In both places, we see great need, as many children, teenagers, athletes, and families come there daily. A freely accessible drinking fountain would significantly improve the quality of life there.",

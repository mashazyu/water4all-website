We hope that by the end of our project, we will be able to prepare a guide that will help residents of other districts achieve the installation of drinking fountains in their areas.\n\nAs part of the project, we decided to focus on installing drinking fountains in two locations: at Kissingen-Stadion (Kissingenstraße sports ground, Forchheimer Str. 22, 13189 Berlin) and at the large children's playground on Trelleborger Straße. In both places, we see great need, as many children, teenagers, athletes, and families come there daily. A freely accessible drinking fountain would significantly improve the quality of life there.",

They do not integrate the locations with Google Maps. Instead, they provide a downloadable .kml file with all fountain coordinates.\n\nWe’ve made it easier for you by turning that data into a Google Maps layer you can add directly to your phone. We also included other public water sources such as libraries, open public schools, and more.\n\nFor even more refill points, check out [Refill](https://refill-deutschland.de/) Berlin, which lists businesses and organizations participating in their program.",
